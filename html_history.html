                <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML provides the structure of the webpage by marking up the text. You can (and should) use variety of HTML tags to build the webpage content. HTML does not have many rules (other than if you open a tag, you should usually close it with a matching tag). One and only h1 tag is a best practice.</p>

For each image set the src wich is the filename; use a relative file path and make sure the filename matches exactly with what is in the src (the case should match exactly) so that the image will load properly on GitHub. Likewise, that is why you need to use relative file paths (./images instead of /images) in this class. -->
